# Equipos ACS Backend
This is an early version of a REST API I developed for an asset management app. It's a NodeJS/Express.js application, using Mongo/Mongoose for models/ORM.

## Built with
- NodeJS/Express.js
- MongoDB/Mongoose
- bcrypt, JWT (for user authentication)

## Requirements 
- NodeJS >= 12.18
- npm >= 6.14
- MongoDB v4

## Notes
The `npm start` script requires nodemon to be installed globally. You can run `npm install -g nodemon` to do this.
